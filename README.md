The process of compiling a grocery list is arduous and boring. Handwritten lists are unorganized and, in practice, have the user running back and forth between aisles in a jumbled frenzy. Wouldn't it be great if there was a swift and relatively effortless mechanism for generating structured, comprehensive grocery lists?

Well now there is! Say goodbye to running 5Ks in the supermarket!

# grocDB

The process of compiling a grocery list is arduous and boring. Handwritten lists are unorganized and, in practice, have the user running back and forth between aisles in a jumbled frenzy. Wouldn't it be great if there was a swift and relatively effortless mechanism for generating structured, comprehensive grocery lists?

Well now there is! Say goodbye to running 5Ks in the supermarket...

...and say hello to grocDB! grocDB reads specially-formatted recipe files whose information is stored into a database - the recipe data can then be retrieved at any time for insertion into a sorted grocery list.
